# Gasless Transactions Implementation for No_Gas_Labs™ & No_Gas_Slaps™

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of gasless transactions for the No_Gas_Labs™ RPG platform and No_Gas_Slaps™ Telegram mini-app using the TON blockchain. The implementation will utilize TON's W5 wallet standard to enable gasless operations as required by Telegram.

## Technical Requirements
1. Integration with TON blockchain
2. Implementation of W5 wallet standard
3. Relay service for transaction fee handling
4. Smart contracts for NFT collections and token distribution

## Implementation Plan

### 1. TON SDK Integration
- Install and configure TON SDK
- Set up connection to TON network
- Implement wallet creation and management

### 2. W5 Wallet Implementation
- Create W5 wallet instances for users
- Implement gasless transaction signing
- Handle wallet state management

### 3. Relay Service
- Build service to handle transaction fees
- Implement fee calculation logic
- Create transaction submission endpoints

### 4. Smart Contract Integration
- Deploy NFT collection smart contracts
- Implement token distribution contracts
- Create interaction layer between backend and smart contracts

## Security Considerations
- Secure key management
- Transaction validation
- Rate limiting for relay service
- Protection against replay attacks

## Implementation Details

### Wallet Management
Users will be assigned W5 wallets that can execute gasless transactions. The wallets will be managed by the relay service which pays the gas fees.

### Transaction Flow
1. User initiates transaction in app
2. Transaction is signed by user's wallet
3. Transaction is sent to relay service
4. Relay service validates and pays gas fees
5. Transaction is submitted to TON network
6. User receives confirmation

### Smart Contracts
- NFT Collection Contract: Manages minting and ownership of game relics
- Token Contract: Handles RELIC token distribution and balances
- Relay Contract: Manages gas fee payments and wallet operations

## Next Steps
1. Set up TON development environment
2. Implement W5 wallet standard
3. Create relay service
4. Develop smart contracts
5. Integrate with backend services
