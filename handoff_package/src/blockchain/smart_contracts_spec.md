# Smart Contracts Specification for No_Gas_Labs™ & No_Gas_Slaps™

## Overview
This document outlines the smart contracts required for the No_Gas_Labs™ RPG platform and No_Gas_Slaps™ Telegram mini-app. These contracts will manage NFT collections for game relics and the RELIC token economy.

## Contract Requirements

### NFT Collection Contract
1. Mint new NFTs with metadata
2. Manage ownership of NFTs
3. Support gasless minting operations
4. Store and retrieve NFT metadata
5. Implement royalty distribution

### Token Contract
1. Manage RELIC token balances
2. Handle token transfers
3. Support gasless token distribution
4. Track token earnings by source
5. Implement vesting schedules for certain rewards

### Relay Service Contract
1. Pay transaction fees on behalf of users
2. Track fee payments
3. Manage wallet operations
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Handle refund mechanisms

## Implementation Plan

### 1. NFT Collection Contract (Tact Language)
- Create collection with minting functionality
- Implement metadata storage
- Add ownership tracking
- Include royalty mechanism

### 2. Token Contract (Tact Language)
- Implement Jetton standard
- Create token distribution functions
- Add balance tracking
- Include vesting schedule support

### 3. Relay Service Contract (Tact Language)
- Create fee payment mechanisms
- Implement transaction validation
- Add rate limiting features
- Include refund functionality

## Security Considerations
- Access control for minting operations
- Transaction validation
- Prevention of double spending
- Rate limiting for relay service
- Protection against replay attacks

## Next Steps
1. Implement NFT collection contract in Tact
2. Implement RELIC token contract in Tact
3. Implement relay service contract in Tact
4. Deploy contracts to TON testnet
5. Integrate with backend services
