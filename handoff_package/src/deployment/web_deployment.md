# No_Gas_Labs™ Web Platform Deployment

## Overview
This document outlines the deployment process for the No_Gas_Labs™ RPG platform. The deployment will use a cloud hosting service with proper scaling and security configurations.

## Deployment Architecture
- Frontend: Static files hosted on CDN
- Backend: Node.js application with PostgreSQL database
- Blockchain: TON network integration
- Caching: Redis for performance optimization
- Monitoring: Application performance monitoring

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Preparation
- Set up cloud hosting account
- Configure domain and SSL certificates
- Prepare environment variables
- Set up database and Redis instances

### 2. Frontend Deployment
- Build optimized React application
- Deploy static files to CDN
- Configure custom domain
- Set up SSL termination

### 3. Backend Deployment
- Deploy Node.js application
- Configure PostgreSQL connection
- Set up Redis caching
- Configure API endpoints

### 4. Blockchain Integration Deployment
- Deploy smart contracts to TON network
- Configure relay service
- Set up wallet management
- Verify contract addresses

### 5. Monitoring and Analytics
- Set up application monitoring
- Configure error tracking
- Implement analytics
- Set up alerting systems

## Environment Variables
- DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
- REDIS_URL: Redis connection string
- TON_ENDPOINT: TON network endpoint
- TON_API_KEY: TON network API key
- RELAY_WALLET_MNEMONIC: Relay wallet mnemonic (secure storage)
- JWT_SECRET: Secret for authentication

## Security Considerations
- Secure key management
- SSL encryption for all communications
- Database connection security
- API rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization

## Scaling Configuration
- Horizontal scaling for backend services
- CDN distribution for frontend assets
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategy implementation

## Backup and Recovery
- Database backup schedule
- Wallet key backup procedures
- Application state recovery
- Disaster recovery plan

## Next Steps
1. Prepare deployment environment
2. Build and deploy frontend
3. Deploy backend services
4. Deploy smart contracts
5. Configure monitoring
6. Test deployment
7. Optimize performance
